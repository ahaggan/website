From the <a class="link" href="yourList.html"><b>Your List</b></a> page, you can copy links from any website containing the gift you would like. You can also write a brief description so that whoever is looking at your list might get a clearer idea as to what the gift is and why you would like it. This might help them pick the gift from your list that best suits them.</p>
                <p>People will then be able to look at your list, find a gift they would like to get you and then click the link to take them to the page or shop they can get your gift from. Once they have decided to buy the gift they will confirm this and the item will be removed from your list to avoid duplicate gifts.</p>

                <p>On the <a class="link" href="findSomeone.html"><b>Find Someone</b></a> page you can type names of your friends and family. When you enter a name, a list of people matching will be displayed and if needed you can use other provided information(DOB or city) to find the correct person. If the person is not registered, you can provide an email address to send them and invitation or just poke them the next time you see them!</p>
                <p>When you click on this person you will be able to see their list. It will look very much like Your List, but will only give you the option to buy the gift or not.</p>
